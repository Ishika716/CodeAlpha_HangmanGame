## Project Description
This repository contains the source code for the Hangman Game project, developed as part of the CodeAlpha Python Programming Internship. [cite_start]The goal was to create a simple text-based Hangman game where the player guesses a word one letter at a time[cite: 26].

## Features (Simplified Scope)
[cite_start]As per the internship task requirements[cite: 26]:
* [cite_start]Uses a small list of 5 predefined words (no need for external files or APIs)[cite: 27].
* [cite_start]Limits incorrect guesses to 6 attempts[cite: 28].
* [cite_start]Provides basic console input/output (no graphics or audio)[cite: 29].

## How to Run
1.  Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2.  Clone this repository to your local machine:
    `git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/CodeAlpha_HangmanGame.git` (Replace 'YourUsername' with your GitHub username)
3.  Navigate to the project directory:
    `cd CodeAlpha_HangmanGame`
4.  Run the game:
    `python HangmanGame.py` (Assuming your main game file is named `HangmanGame.py`)

## Key Concepts Used
[cite_start]This project utilized fundamental Python concepts, including[cite: 30]:
* `random` module for word selection
* `while` loops for game flow
* `if-else` statements for decision-making
* String manipulation
* Lists for managing game state (e.g., guessed letters, word display)
